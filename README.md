# React Native Blackjack

Live coded app to revisit and solidify the basics of React Native app development. This repo will be updated along with the lessons. See also: https://github.com/isilher/react-native-basics

## Concept

A simple native app with two screens

### Lobby

- Shows a list of games
- Has a button to create a new game
- Pressing a game navigates to the Game Screen for that particular game

### Game Screen

- Shows the currently selected game (or an empty state)
- Pressing 'close game' will revert the screen to the empty state
- Allows a player to play Blackjack (complete with drawing cards and counting score)

## API

This project uses the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com) by @crobertsbmw.
